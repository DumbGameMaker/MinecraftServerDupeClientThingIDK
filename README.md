# MinecraftServerDupeClientThingIDK
A spigot plugin + minecraft mod pair where people with the 
client can use common dupes such as the Donkey dupe, Book 
dupe, and Bed dupe. Made because there aren't (m)any dupe
plugins and I think running /dupe is a little op, plus this
is a cool project for me to learn minecraft and spigot modding.

	NOTE: This is NOT a cheat client, (At least not in the 
	traditional sense)and can NOT be used to enable dupes that
	normally would be banned on servers. The client only works
	on servers with the plugin. I cannot guarantee that you won't
	be banned on servers for having this plugin installed not 
	because its a cheat client, but because it might not be an
	allowed modification.
	
# Installation
## Compilation
If you are nerdy enough to have an IDE or use Maven, you can 
probably compile it yourself. It's really just make a maven 
project, delete the POM, put the source code into the
./src/main/java/\<name\> folder
## Installation
### Server
Move the plugin to /plugins/
### Client
I'll probably use fabric so I can relese the source code so 
just move the mod to %appdata%/.minecraft/mods on windows or 
~/Shared Libraries/minecraft/mods on mac and it works!
